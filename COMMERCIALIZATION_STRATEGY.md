## 📌 Purpose
This strategy outlines how TEOS BankChain Mobile transitions from **pilot deployments** into **global commercialization**.  
It covers SaaS offerings, enterprise licensing, and white‑label models for banks and fintechs.

## 🧭 Commercialization Models

### 1. SaaS (Software‑as‑a‑Service)
- Hosted by TEOS Egypt in secure cloud environments (AWS/Azure).  
- Subscription‑based pricing (monthly/annual).  
- Includes compliance modules (KYC, AML, SAR, regulator exports).  
- Automatic updates and protocol upgrades.  
- Ideal for mid‑size banks and fintechs seeking rapid deployment.  

---

### 2. Enterprise Licensing
- On‑premises deployment for large banks with strict regulator requirements.  
- One‑time licensing fee + annual support contract.  
- Customizable compliance modules aligned with local regulators (CBE, SAMA, FCA, FATF).  
- Dedicated support team for integration and audits.  
- Ideal for Tier‑1 banks requiring full control and regulator visibility.  

---

### 3. White‑Label Solutions
- TEOS platform rebranded under partner bank/fintech identity.  
- Custom UI/UX, branding, and localized language support.  
- Treasury contributions and staking rewards remain linked to TEOS governance.  
- NFT governance tokens minted under partner brand.  
- Ideal for fintechs expanding into digital banking and crypto gateways.
