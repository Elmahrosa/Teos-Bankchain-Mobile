## 📌 Purpose

## 🧭 Engagement Phases

### Phase 1 — Relationship Establishment
- Sign NDA and proprietary license agreements.  
- Assign regulator liaison officers (TEOS + regulator).  
- Share compliance framework overview (KYC, AML, SAR, audit logging).  
- Provide sandbox API keys for regulator testing.  

---

### Phase 2 — Compliance Workshops
- Conduct regulator workshops covering:  
  - KYC ingestion (`POST /compliance/kyc`)  
  - AML scoring (`POST /compliance/aml-check`)  
  - SAR generation (`POST /compliance/sar`)  
  - Regulator export (`GET /compliance/export`)  
- Demonstrate immutable audit logs and retention policies.  
- Provide regulator training manuals and certification pathways.  

---

### Phase 3 — Audit Dialogues
- Schedule quarterly audit dialogues with regulators.  
- Share compliance reports (CBE, SAMA, FCA, FATF).  
- Validate regulator export formats (CSV, JSON, XML).  
- Conduct dry‑run audits with regulator observers.  
- Document regulator feedback and integrate into roadmap.  

---

### Phase 4 — Reporting & Transparency
- Deliver regulator reports via secure channels (SFTP, HTTPS, regulator portal).  
- Include signed manifest: `{file_hash, record_count, generated_by, signature}`.  
- Provide dashboards for regulator oversight (balances, compliance alerts, treasury contributions, governance votes).  
- Enable regulator access to immutable audit trails.  

---

### Phase 5 — Continuous Alignment
- Align TEOS roadmap milestones with regulator expectations.  
- Share quarterly updates on treasury, staking, governance, and protocol upgrades.  
- Conduct annual compliance certification for partner banks.
