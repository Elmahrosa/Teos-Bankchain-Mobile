## 🧭 Certification Layers

### Local Certification
- Conducted by national regulators (CBE, SAMA, FCA, EU).  
- Scope: compliance modules (KYC, AML, SAR), treasury contributions, governance votes.  
- Certification logs published in immutable audit trails.  

### Regional Certification
- Aggregates local certifications into regional compliance councils (MENA, EU, LATAM, APAC).  
- Oversees treasury liquidity pools and staking reward distribution.  
- Conducted quarterly with regulator observers.  

### Global Certification
- Consolidates regional certifications into FATF‑aligned global compliance.  
- Enforces Travel Rule for cross‑border transactions.  
- Publishes global certification seals via `/certification/results`.  
- Conducted annually with FATF observers.

## 📑 Certification Phases

### Phase 1 — Preparation
- Define certification scope (governance, treasury, compliance, audit, risk).  
- Provision sandbox environments for regulator testing.  
- Draft certification documentation (CERTIFICATION_MANIFEST.md, COMPLIANCE_EXPORT_GUIDE.md).  

### Phase 2 — Execution
- Validate compliance endpoints (KYC, AML, SAR, export).  
- Audit treasury contributions and governance votes.  
- Run penetration testing and static analysis.  
- Record results in immutable audit logs.  

### Phase 3 — Reporting
- Export regulator‑ready certification reports (CSV/JSON/XML).  
- Provide signed manifest: `{file_hash, record_count, generated_by, signature}`.  
- Deliver reports via secure channels (SFTP, HTTPS, regulator portal).  

### Phase 4 — Ratification
- Local regulators certify compliance.  
- Regional councils aggregate certifications.  
- Global council ratifies certification.  
- Publish immutable certification seals.
