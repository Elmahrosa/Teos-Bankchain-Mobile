# Incident Response Plan — Teos Bankchain Mobile

This document defines the **incident response framework** for Teos Bankchain Mobile.  
It ensures regulator‑aligned handling of security events, breaches, and compliance alerts.  
Governed by the **TEOS Egypt Sovereign License (TESL v2.0)** — **NOT for sale**, for sovereign use only.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Detect, contain, and remediate incidents quickly.  
- Maintain **regulator trust** through transparent reporting.  
- Protect customer data, financial flows, and civic infrastructure.  
- Align with **CBE, SAMA, FATF, IMF, BIS, and OFAC** standards.

## 🛡 Incident Categories
- **Security Breach** → Unauthorized access, data exfiltration, credential compromise.  
- **Compliance Violation** → AML/CFT failure, sanctions breach, audit trail tampering.  
- **Operational Failure** → Downtime, infrastructure outage, CI/CD pipeline break.  
- **Fraud / Abuse** → Suspicious transactions, insider threats, account misuse.  
- **Regulator Alert** → Requests from CBE, SAMA, ECB, OFAC, FATF, IMF, BIS.

## 📊 Response Workflow

### 1. Detection
- Automated monitoring (SIEM, AML engine, sanctions screening).  
- Alerts from regulators, partners, or internal staff.  
- Logs flagged in **Immutable Audit Ledger**.

### 2. Classification
- Severity levels: **Critical, High, Medium, Low**.  
- Impact assessment: customer, regulator, financial, reputational.  
- Assign incident owner (security officer or compliance lead).

### 3. Containment
- Isolate affected systems (air‑gap mode if required).  
- Suspend suspicious accounts or transactions.  
- Block compromised API keys or credentials.

### 4. Eradication
- Patch vulnerabilities (code, infra, container).  
- Remove malicious files, scripts, or unauthorized access.  
- Reset credentials and enforce MFA.

### 5. Recovery
- Restore services from backups.  
- Validate system integrity with penetration tests.  
- Resume normal operations under regulator oversight.

### 6. Reporting
- Generate **incident report** in JSON/CSV format.  
- Notify regulators (CBE, SAMA, ECB, OFAC, FATF, IMF, BIS).  
- Share findings with internal stakeholders and auditors.

### 7. Lessons Learned
- Conduct post‑mortem review.  
- Update playbooks, CI/CD pipelines, and compliance docs.  
- Train staff on new procedures.
