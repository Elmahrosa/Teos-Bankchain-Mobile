## 👤 Founder Statement

TEOS Egypt is currently developed and governed by a **single founder**.

I work independently and am preparing the TEOS ecosystem for presentation and strategic engagement at **Consensus Hong Kong (HK)**.

All development, governance direction, and licensing decisions are made by the founder until formal institutional partnerships or governance bodies are established.
