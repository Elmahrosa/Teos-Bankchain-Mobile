## 🧭 Governance Layers

### Layer 1 — Local Governance
- Partner banks and fintechs mint NFT governance tokens.  
- Voting rights proportional to staked governance tokens.  
- Local regulator oversight (CBE, SAMA, FCA, FATF).  
- Decisions limited to jurisdiction‑specific compliance modules.  

### Layer 2 — Regional Governance
- Aggregates local votes into regional councils (MENA, EU, LATAM, APAC).  
- Oversees treasury contribution rates and staking reward distribution.  
- Aligns with regional regulators (SAMA, FCA, EU PSD2/GDPR).  
- Provides quarterly reports to TEOS Egypt Governance Team.  

### Layer 3 — Global Governance
- Consolidates regional votes into global protocol decisions.  
- Oversees protocol upgrades, compliance frameworks, and treasury liquidity flows.  
- Aligns with FATF standards for cross‑border compliance.  
- Publishes governance results via `/governance/results`.
