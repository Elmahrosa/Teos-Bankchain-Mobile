### 2. Treasury Enforcement
- Contribution fee (default 0.25%) deducted automatically per transaction.

- Quarterly staking rewards distributed without exception.  
- Treasury reports exported to regulators via `/treasury/reports`.  

### 3. Compliance Enforcement

- AML scoring and sanctions/PEP screening enforced in real time.  
- SAR generation automatic for suspicious activity.  
- Compliance logs immutable and regulator‑accessible.  

### 4. Audit Enforcement
- Quarterly audits executed at local, regional, and global levels.  
- Reports exported in regulator‑ready formats (CSV/JSON/XML).  
- Signed manifest required: `{file_hash, record_count, generated_by, signature}`.  
- Annual FATF certification enforced globally.  

### 5. Risk Enforcement
- Risk register updated quarterly.
