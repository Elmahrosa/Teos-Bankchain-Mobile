# Global Constitutional Resilience Framework — TEOS BankChain Mobile 🌍🛡️

⚠️ **Private Document — Restricted to Partner Banks, Fintechs & Regulators Only**  
Access is limited to institutions operating under direct agreement with TEOS Egypt.  
Redistribution or public disclosure is prohibited.

---

## 📌 Purpose
This framework defines the **resilience model** for TEOS BankChain Mobile under the International Civic Blockchain Constitution.  
It ensures operations remain **robust, adaptive, and regulator‑aligned** during crises, disruptions, or systemic stress.

---

## 🧭 Resilience Domains

### 1. Technical Resilience
- Redundant infrastructure deployed across regions (MENA, EU, LATAM, APAC).  
- Daily backups verified and replicated.  
- Disaster recovery playbooks executed automatically.  
- Immutable audit logs replicated across nodes.  

### 2. Operational Resilience
- Emergency governance dashboard activated during crises.  
- Treasury pools maintained with regional redundancy.  
- Compliance modules (KYC, AML, SAR) remain active in continuity environments.  
- Quarterly drills conducted with regulator observers.  

### 3. Compliance Resilience
- Regulator‑ready exports delivered via redundant secure channels (SFTP, HTTPS, regulator portal).  
- FATF Travel Rule enforced even under stress conditions.  
- GDPR/PSD2 data privacy maintained during failover.  
- Immutable compliance logs accessible globally.  

### 4. Governance Resilience
- Local, regional, and global councils maintain quorum via secure remote voting.  
- NFT governance tokens enforce proportional voting rights.  
- Regulator observers retain oversight during emergency sessions.  
- Governance results published in `/governance/resilience`.  

### 5. Reputational Resilience
- Transparent communication with banks, fintechs, and regulators during crises.  
- Immutable audit logs shared publicly when regulator‑approved.  
- Crisis communication playbooks executed (GLOBAL_MARKETING_PLAYBOOK.md + GLOBAL_INVESTOR_RELATIONS_GUIDE.md).  
- Quarterly reputational reviews conducted.

## 📑 Resilience Phases

### Phase 1 — Prevention
- Deploy redundant infrastructure and backups.  
- Conduct regulator dry‑run resilience drills.  
- Update risk registers quarterly.  

### Phase 2 — Response
- Detect incident via SIEM dashboards.  
- Activate emergency governance dashboard.  
- Switch treasury and compliance modules to continuity mode.  

### Phase 3 — Recovery
- Execute disaster recovery playbooks.  
- Restore treasury and governance dashboards.  
- Verify immutable audit logs.  

### Phase 4 — Review
- Conduct post‑incident review with regulator observers.  
- Update resilience framework with regulator feedback.  
- Publish resilience results globally.
