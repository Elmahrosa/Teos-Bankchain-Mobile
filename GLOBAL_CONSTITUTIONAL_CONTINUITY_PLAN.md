## 🧭 Continuity Domains

### 1. Governance Continuity
- Local, regional, and global councils maintain quorum via secure remote voting.  
- Immutable audit logs ensure governance decisions remain valid during crises.  
- Emergency governance dashboard activated for regulator observers.  

### 2. Treasury Continuity
- Contribution fee (default 0.25%) deducted automatically even during outages.  
- Treasury pools replicated across regions (MENA, EU, LATAM, APAC).  
- Quarterly staking rewards distributed without delay.  
- Treasury balances accessible via `/treasury/continuity`.  

### 3. Compliance Continuity
- KYC, AML, and SAR modules remain active in disaster recovery environments.  
- Compliance exports delivered via redundant secure channels (SFTP, HTTPS, regulator portal).  
- Immutable compliance logs replicated across regions.  

### 4. Audit Continuity
- Quarterly audits executed even during crises.  
- Reports exported in regulator‑ready formats (CSV/JSON/XML).  
- Signed manifest required: `{file_hash, record_count, generated_by, signature}`.  
- FATF certification maintained via continuity council.  

### 5. Risk Continuity
- Risk register updated in real time during incidents.  
- SIEM dashboards monitor anomalies continuously.  
- Incident response playbooks executed (SECURITY_AUDIT_PLAYBOOK.md, DISASTER_RECOVERY_PLAYBOOK.md).  
- Post‑incident reviews mandatory and logged.
